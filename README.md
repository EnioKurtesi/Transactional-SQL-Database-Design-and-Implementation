Transactional SQL Database Design and Implementation

In the project related to transactional SQL, we began by designing and implementing a database schema. This involved defining the structure and relationships of the tables required for the project. We used Data Definition Language (DDL) statements to create the tables and establish their attributes, primary keys, foreign keys, and any necessary constraints.

Next, we performed Data Manipulation Language (DML) operations to insert, update, and delete data within the tables. These operations allowed us to populate the tables with relevant information and maintain data integrity throughout the project.

In addition to basic database operations, we also developed five complex queries. These queries involved multiple tables, join operations, aggregations, and conditional statements to retrieve specific data based on various criteria. The complexity of these queries allowed us to extract meaningful insights from the database and answer specific business or analytical questions.

To enhance the functionality of the database, we implemented triggers. Triggers are database objects that automatically execute certain actions in response to specific events, such as insertions, updates, or deletions in the tables. By using triggers, we were able to enforce additional business rules, maintain data consistency, and perform necessary actions whenever specific events occurred.

We also created procedures using cursors. Cursors are database objects that allow iterative processing of query results. By utilizing cursors in our procedures, we were able to retrieve and process data row by row, perform calculations or transformations, and execute specific actions based on the retrieved data.

Furthermore, we developed functions, which are reusable blocks of code that return a value based on input parameters. These functions were designed to perform specific calculations, transformations, or data manipulations and could be called from queries, procedures, or triggers to simplify complex operations and improve code modularity.
